# Sound Intensity Measurement

<p>
The purpose of this project was create a device that is able to measure the intensity of sounds. A script will continuously read data about the sound intensity in the environment and trigger an RGB led depending on the value of the intensity <br><br> I used an RGB LED to express the different intensity levels. (Blue - low, Green - Middle, Red - high) <br>If the LED is blue that implies that the sound levels are low, if the green LED is on that means the levels are slightly	elevated and if it red LED is on that means the intensity reached a high enough lvl d

<br><br>This project might be useful if you want to make sure that the noise in space does not go over a certain threshold. This way you will have a visual  representation of the sound intensity.</p>
